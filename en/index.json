We often hear the refrain, \u0026ldquo;Correlation is not causation,\u0026rdquo; reminding us of the pitfalls of assuming a cause-and-effect relationship based exclusively on observed associations. For example, the fact that there is a positive correlation between ice cream sales and the number of crimes does not necessarily mean that the first ones produce the last.","date":"2023-09-17T07:58:53+02:00","permalink":"https://gero1999.github.io/en/blog/to_cause_or_not_to_cause/","tags":["causality","philosophy"],"title":"To Cause or not to Cause"},{"author":"Gerardo J.

BRA measure is used to make a binary operation: support or withhold a particular medical treatment. This assessment is paramount to ensure that the benefits of a treatment outweigh the associated risks, which corresponds one of the three basic Belmont principles. But how is it actually done?","date":"2023-09-16T07:58:53+02:00","permalink":"https://gero1999.github.io/en/blog/bra_algorithms/","tags":["pharmacovigilance","bayesian"],"title":"From Ethics to Clinical Algorithms"},{"author":"Gerardo J.
