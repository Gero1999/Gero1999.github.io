<h2 id="unraveling-the-enigma-of-causation-beyond-correlation">Unraveling the Enigma of Causation: Beyond Correlation</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Causation&rdquo; is a term frequently tossed around in scientific and
everyday conversations alike. We often hear the refrain, &ldquo;Correlation is
not causation,&rdquo; reminding us of the pitfalls of assuming a
cause-and-effect relationship based exclusively on observed
associations. For example, the fact that there is a positive correlation
between ice cream sales and the number of crimes does not necessarily
mean that the first ones produce the last. A potential alternative
explanation can be that they both share a common cause (such as the
weather). But then, what it is actually causation?</p>
<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<h3 id="david-humes-regularity-theory">David Hume&rsquo;s Regularity Theory</h3>
<p>Philosophers and scholars have grappled with this question for
centuries, offering a range of interpretations. One influential
perspective on causation emerged in the 18th century through the musings
of philosopher David Hume. He proposed the &ldquo;regularity theory of
causation&rdquo;, suggesting that causation is identified and defined through
consistent observations of two spatially contiguous entities, where one
acts before the other.</p>
<p><img src="/billiard-balls-illustration.jpg" alt="Billiard Balls Illustration"> <em>Image
Source: Pixabay</em></p>
<p>Consider a simple example: two billiard balls on a table, Ball A and
Ball B. When Ball A strikes Ball B, causing it to move, we might
naturally conclude that A&rsquo;s impact caused B&rsquo;s motion. In order to belive
that we need to assume many things that might or not be true. Let&rsquo;s
discuss them:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensory Perception is accurate</strong>: The first thing we need to
believe is that what our senses are capturing is representing the
reality of the universe. In other words, we need to challenge the
methodological doubt proposed by René Descartes (&ldquo;Cogito, ergo sum&rdquo;)
and believe in more than our existance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporal Priority</strong>: According to Hume, causation involves one
event happening before another. However, this raises intriguing
questions about the origin of time and the universe itself, which
based on this definition might lack a clear cause. In more general
terms, any potential self-causation can result in an ambiguous
problem (commonly known as the Ex Nihilo Paradox)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spatial Contiguity</strong>: Hume emphasized the importance of spatial
proximity between cause and effect, even though this relationship
can be abstract. But what then about the cause of a cause? Isn&rsquo;t
also a cause that is somehow distant?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constant Conjunction</strong>: This is the key of the epistemiological
meaening that we humans usually give to causality. Hume noticed that
causation is identified when events often appear connected due to
shared causes. For example, we assume that ball A&rsquo;s hit is causing
ball B&rsquo;s movement because every single time A happened B also did.
And here is where Hume moved the scientific world&rsquo;s by pointing out
the axiom that moves every predictive science: believing that the
fact that past evidences are useful for future predictions. In
someway, he is critizing that we are believing that what could be
happening by mere chance (a hundred, thousand or million of times)
is acquiring a sufficient value to be considered an immutable truth.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="new-persepctives-counterfactual-causality">New persepctives: Counterfactual Causality</h3>
<p>In the 20th century, a new definition of causality known as
&ldquo;counterfactual causality was introduced.&rdquo; This principle assesses
causation by examining how outcomes vary when alternative possibilities
to the presumed cause are considered. If these outcomes diverge, we
conclude that causality exists.</p>
<p>However, this definition has certain limitations. In our reality,
individual things only occur once and in a particular way, producing the
outcome we observe (the factual), but we are then not able to observe
the alterative situations (counterfactuals). Empirically speaking, we
cannot simply travel to the past and reobserve things&hellip; But, what if we
could?</p>
<p>Imagine if we could reset our observations to the exact point when A is
(or not) happening. Depending on our vision on causality&rsquo;s certainty we
could observe two different situations:</p>
<p>and explore various universe perspectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>In a Deterministic Universe</strong> all processes, even those beyond
human prediction, are predetermined. The fact that A causes B (if it
does) is a certainty. Every particular time A is present with that
set of conditions, B happens. Would it make any difference then to
go to the past? Not really. Because just like A causes B, there&rsquo;s
always something else (another event) causing A. So, no matter what
we do, in this pre-planned sequence of events in the world, A always
happens, and no other option (counterfactual) is possible.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where it gets fascinating. According to David Lewis, we
can imagine other realities, like parallel universes, where an
endless chain of events can unfold differently. In this view,
causality can actually make sense in a deterministic world.</p>
<p>In other words, even though events seem to happen one after the
other like clockwork, there&rsquo;s room for a grander picture where
causality takes on a deeper meaning in a universe of infinite
possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In a Stochastic Universe</strong> events have associated probabilities. A
is not certain that it will cause B, even if the conditions are the
same. In the same way, causes of A don&rsquo;t consistently lead to A
happening if we reset observations. This perspective allows the use
of the past to learn about causality, but introduces subjectivity
into its concept, as the definition becomes contingent on
probabilities.</p>
<p>When can we actually define that A causes B? Is it when is almost
certain that will make it happen and the probability is practically
1? Or is good enough that probability is simlpy superior to 0? Would
you say that something that unlikely ends producing an effect, is
its cause?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/tcontc2.jpg" alt="Parallel Universes"> <em>Figure 2. Our universal
situation is perhaps just one of the infinite realities that exist</em></p>
<h1 id="heading-3"></h1>
<h2 id="the-complexity-of-causation">The Complexity of Causation</h2>
<p>In light of these philosophical perspectives, causation appears to be
either indeterminable, nonexistent, or subjective. It&rsquo;s a complex topic
with no easy answers, and it continues to be a subject of exploration
and debate.</p>
<p>Causation may or not be a simple logical ideal object, in the same way
as a formula or a perfect shaped circle. It is definitely very useful,
but its application towards the real and complex world could perhaps be
no more than that at all.</p>
<p>However, while the ideas presented in this article provide my little
insight into the matter, there are not definitive conclusions anywhere.
Causality remains a rich field of inquiry, inviting further exploration
and discussion. And you, what is your opinion? Do you have a good
definition for causality? If so, don&rsquo;t forget to set your causes!</p>
